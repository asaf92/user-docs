# Detecting CloudFormation configuration files using a Broker

When you are using a privately hosted Git repository, Snyk Broker must be used to connect with Snyk products. See the [Broker documentation](../) for details.

This page explains the additional configuration required for the CloudFormation files for Snyk IaC.

Part of these configurations will be the same for Kubernetes. If they have already been added for Kubernetes, there is no need to add them again.

## Writing the configuration

The CloudFormation scanning features require access to the YAML or JSON files in the repository. This requires specific API permissions. These API permissions are slightly different depending on the source control system.

1. Find the appropriate accept.json sample file for the correct source control system and download [from the Broker repository](https://github.com/snyk/broker/tree/master/client-templates).
2. Rename the file `accept.json` and add to the **private** array in the JSON file, add the rules that follow as appropriate to your SCM .
3. Follow the instructions for [Configuring Broker](detecting-cloudformation-configuration-files-using-a-broker.md#configuring-broker).

},
```

## Configuring Broker

Broker takes the path to the accept.json file, with the applicable rules added, in the ACCEPT environment variable. The following provides an example of passing that variable to the GitHub Broker.

```
docker run --restart=always \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
  -e PORT=8000 \
  -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=https://my.broker.client:8000 \
  -e ACCEPT=/private/accept.json
  -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
  snyk/broker:github-com
```

Note that this gives Snyk the ability to query for any `.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json` files. If you would prefer to be stricter, you can alter the paths in the preceding examples to be more restrictive for certain projects or file layouts.
